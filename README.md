# MyPortfolio
I am Shanmugapriya. With a strong foundation in Business Analytics, backed by an MSc in Business Analytics from the UK. I specialize in data management, predictive modelling, data visualization and machine learning. With proficiency in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and Excel, I transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

In this portfolio, you will find projects demonstrating my expertise in data preprocessing, statistical modelling and visualization techniques. Some key highlights include my Sports Center Attendance Prediction project, where I applied machine learning techniques to identify key factors influencing user attendance and my Marketing Analytics project, which provided actionable insights for Hepatitis Diagnosis.

I am highly analytical and passionate about solving real-world business challenges through data-driven strategies. I enjoy working in collaborative environments, where I can leverage my skills to optimize processes and enhance decision-making.
